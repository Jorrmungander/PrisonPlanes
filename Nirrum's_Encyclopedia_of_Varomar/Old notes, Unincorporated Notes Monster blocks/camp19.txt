Iyrelm won't leave until you sell all of the loot
"excess weight will hamper our journey, Trust me on that, Trade down for gems and spices, leave the furs, they'll be worth more in the west. Stock up Lads, get your money and your goods. This is gonna be a long stretch." (don't forget to dock 600 gold for the crew's wages)

The inner city is essentially sealed off but the south port, where the sister is docked is open and rich. The town offers much in the way of entertainment. Iyrelm sets off on his own across the bridge.

At any of the Taverns, the group is accosted by some local ruffians. 

At some point the next day, Iyrelm comes running back into town to whomever is awake
"ROIT, GET THE SHIP READY, DON'T ASK, JUST SET SAIL"

He is chased by a horde of armed knights.

When the ship is sailing he tells the drummer to drum fast and tells cosades to whip up something to make the boat go faster. A small navy's worth of ships looses from the docks

One of the smaller ships catches up. 10 guards

Iyrelm Directs the ship toward a mass of green in the west.

"ROIT, WE'RE GOIN INTA THE GROVES, HALF OF YOU DROP THE OARS AND GET INTO THE RIGGING. DROP THE BOOMS ONTO DECK AND LASH'EM DOWN."

The crew begins to loose the hundred ropes that hold up the booms on which the triangular sails rest. Another of the fleet is catching up as the ship drifts in among a river that is surrounded by thick trees, all immersed in water with no visible ground.

Another 10 guards depending.

No further guards follow.
