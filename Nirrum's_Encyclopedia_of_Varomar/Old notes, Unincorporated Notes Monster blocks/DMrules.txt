MY DM RULES

1) Build your characters at the table
	You need to have reasons to trust eachother and compromise on building your characters
2) I will allow homebrew
	let me know what you need, I will veto some and allow some
3) Almost Any race is allowed, including homebrew, provided they are balanced to my liking. I have charts for this
4) Despite what the rules say, you cannot prone a snake, fish, or any creature that does not have a visible orientation
5) Rule 5 is Entirely Incorrect
6) The most recent ranger  UA overwrites the ranger class, similarly, the way of four elements monk has a rework
7) Discussions are held IN CHARACTER, some exceptions will be made depending on stats
8) DnD is a commitment, I ask that you show up every. single. week. If you're going to miss it, give me notice and you have 
	to find someone to play your character.
9) The following elements of he game have been changed or expanded upon
	i. Druids can target greatclubs, clubs, and staves for the purposes of the cantrip shillelagh
	ii. Tenser's floating disc reads as the 4th edition version did
	iii. The weight of the pike has been halved
	iv. The trident is now 1d8 instead of 1d6 and 2d4 versatile
	v. Unarmed strikes can count as light weapons for the purpose of off-hand attacks
10) Your Character's goal cannot be a desk job. You are an adventurer. It's a bummer if a character leaves because they got the job they wanted.
	

	
Some reminders
	Warlock spell slots recharge on a short rest
	Conjure animals does not let you pick the animals
	Animate Dead summons don't go away
