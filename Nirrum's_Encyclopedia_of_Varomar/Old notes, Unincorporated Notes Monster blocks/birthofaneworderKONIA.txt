The birth of a New Order. 
The city is filled with demons, devils, and undead every night

Completing quests for the following Groups will get them to Ally with you

Ghost Hunters CLEARED
	They get game from the ghost forest and are fantastically skilled but are blocked from creating a guild by Waukeen's Clerics, who won't give up the building without a trade stacked in their favour.
		Waukeen's clerics need a vault to house their assets and to set up a bank but are unable to find one because of the overwhelming tide of undead that roams the upper districts where the old banks where stationed 
		

Senate Paladins CLEAREDish
	Many of these people are fed up with the Clerics Bickering and the endless Bureaucracy (THANKS AUREON). They need a reason to ignore the clerics (you see a man running from a building. Russian accent)

Urchins CLEARED
	They're still around, somehow, but they don't exactly favour any gods. The Senate is becoming an increasing problem for them because they're inadvertently destroying them. Many of them resort to thievery and get locked up in the old Minor Jail, Either way, they know the city inside and out.

The standing army
	The standing army Is currently wary of Khalidor who recently attacked and slaughtered an entire fortress to the north, But they'll probably help if the senate is out of the way. 

The Senate itself
	The bickering ranks of bureaucrats must be brought under control.
