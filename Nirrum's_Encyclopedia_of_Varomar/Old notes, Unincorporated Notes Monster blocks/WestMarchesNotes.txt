Good Day and hello there! I am Nirrum, and on average, the author of this volume. I've been channelling some mysterious force -which honestly just seems to be an alternate version of myself- in order to bring you this book! It has come to my attention that even some of the highest ranks of archmage in many other planes don't know of our home! Snarl is the name of this broken prison plane. It is one of many in this region of the far realm, all and each designed to act as the cell for a single eldritch entity. These entities vary greatly in nature and form, but they each have a similar theme. One aspect of the universe would be targeted and consumed without regard for consequence or order. In our particular plane, that aspect is death. Teruna, the consumer of deaht's long arm, has been locked away under our plane, allowing the natural order to continue, as well as the concept of healing magic to exist. I have seen experiments done with the demon's energy and let me be clear it is not a good thing to be immortal in the way it would deliver it. There are other such creatures, too. One which hates life, one which resets time and consumes the difference, and another that just eats and freezes time entirely. There's one that eats magic, and one of our sister worlds, Earth, has unfortunately fallen to its terrifying maw. Not many have heard of that place. I hear from those who used to live there that there are less dragons there, but more mysteries. One of them eats dreams, thus consuming memory. Another has been revealed recently to wish to "become perfect" by consuming "perfection". Thankfully we live on the least crazy carnival grounds, Don't you think? I suspect you'd like to know more about us.
There are forces on the plane, each conspiring to topple what order we have. From the God-king of Kholira who seeks to enslave us all (and burn my library, which I will not allow), to the cult of changelings that seeks to unleash Teruna, to the Criminals that are the Furi, to the assorted fiends that get banished here on a dialy basis. But outside of them, the plane is relatively peaceful! Kind of! The Cities here are large and thriving because they lay in the safer areas. The problem with prison planes is that they often act as a sort of net for things cast adrift among the planes. Infrequently, about one in 640 000, creatures hit with the banish spell, or banishing smite, or any sort of deplanarization process will end up breaking through the spell's tenuous hold,and become hurtled through the planes, usually landing in the feywild or shadowfell or being picked up by some interplanar traffic. One in one hundred and sixty thousand of those end up on one of the prison planes. I do not fully understand the mathematics behind it, but our plane is uniquely shaped, such that you can be anyone from anywhere at any time. People have met their heroes separated by centuries, their ancestors, their descendants, their gods. I am told there is an equillibrium where you cannot meet yourself (Here at least) and that there are all sorts of time angles and trajectories involved in it. The Second law of thermodynamics is certainly involved. That Bastard. People leaving the plane may pop out in their own past, in the future, or in rare instances, simply die in the process.

Unfortunately this means that the things that end up in this plane are the things that tend to get banished more often than others. Humanoids of all races sure, but a staggering amount of demons and monsters. Before my people, the Manarahi, left the underdark, we were all subject to intense horror, as our mazelike tunnels were filled with horrors that other planes didn't want to deal with. You can ask Tarn Ravora about it, he was there. The surface is far more hospitable, hosting a nice array of climates despite its small size. On this plane, mistakes can mean death, ands lines of communication between towns tends to be mercantile or magical exclusively.
Travel is another way of saying death wish. Unless you're an adventurer of course. Hordes of hoards of treasured treasures from all over the multiverse gather here and build up in the lairs of dragons, in the ruins of fallen cities, and in the retirement funds of deceased adventurers who were once like you. Plenty to get, plenty of people to save. Plenty of books to find and bring to my library in exchange for executive quality magical items fresh from the artificery. Manaharamu, the university, the big building shaped like a glass staircase facing south east. Ask for Nirrum. Speaking of which! Such a plane obviously ends up with the (obviously second) most powerful mages. Mordenkainen, Tenser, Merlin, and all sorts have ended up here one way or another, and are all pleased to learn of the University of Manaharamu, the largest magical university  in many places (though not far from us is a plane so far advanced we can barely communicate with them). Dwarves flock to the Volcano of Skalmirthon for its rich ore,
Pirates to grand tortuga for a good mooring ground. With over three million square miles of overworld and much much more underdark Wherever you come from, and wherever you'll go, Welcome! 

I am unfortunately sorry to say that your centaur friends are probably dead. The sun has a tendency to eat them on the way in. OH, and don't stare at the sun, it gets uncomfortable and we need it to chase away the moon. Don't stare at the moon either. Don't stare at the moon.




```Rules Variants for Nirrum's Games!```
 Let me know if you want to be native to the setting you do not have to be, but alien characters have a chance of instant removal via banishment, as per the banishment spell. This way people can have their favourite PCs pop into existance and out of it when reasonable so you don't have to violate your personal canon.

When building a character use point buy or standard array!

As this is a west-marches like, ask for other player's availability to play and the DM will try to accomodate!


* Summon steed does not actually specify a horse, so in most games, it can be anything so long as it has the stats and abilities of a horse or tiny changes within reason.
* For the purposes of Shillelagh, Druids can target staves, greatclubs, clubs, and really anything that was grown first.
* Druids can wear metal, in fact, they frequently do. Turns out that metal is just as natural as wood, especially when some trees have thought it in their best interest to lace their lignin with aluminum.
* The racial requistes for classes or archetypes can be thrown out entirely. Somewhere in the universe, there is a human who learned how to be a spellsinger, or something similar enough, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out how to use battlerager amor.
* Water breathing now also includes protections from the water and its salinity, though not necessarily pressure.
* Wizards, sorcerers, druids, knowledge and arcana domain clerics, Artificers, Bards, and warlocks can all see a new color, octarine. Octarine light tends to show up in dense magical fields as Mana is converted into thaumatic energy. While it won't reliably allow a caster to spot magical items, it might help, especially if the item isn't concealing its magical nature. Octarine is impossible to pin on a color wheel, as each individual will interpret what color it is closer to differently.  Things that have octarine pigment will appear as if that pigment is not there, Octarine colored cotton would show up as white for example. Materials that are transparent but carry octarine pigment will be opaque to such casters but transparent to non-casters or other types of casters. It is up to the DM to decide any changes to this, but it makes for great puzzles. 
    * This is retroactive, even to characters from other planes who weren't born able to see this color. This has to do with the equivalent of Magical Rayleigh Scattering and the Narrativium Quotient of this section of the far realm
* The Nature of the plane selects more evil creatures than it does good, and one might find that alignment in traditionally good creatures tends to be skewed evil. Generations might change this but 
* Teleport, if cast at 8th level can open a portal up to 100 feet across
* a creature being targeted by gentle repose does not need to have eyes but in fact just needs to be in contact with the two copper pieces. The denizens of the plane often carry a wristlet with two mounted copper pieces in them for just such an occasion,  but industrial versions of these bands tend to be made from wool.
* Square of the spell level multiplied by 10 gp plus DOUBLE of the consumed material cost plus 10% of nonconsumed material cost for purchasing casted spells.
* If multiclassing Ranger and Paladin into eachother, consult the spell slots table for either for determining how many spell slots you have at your total level rather than the multiclassing table. A 3 Paladin/2 ranger has two level two spell slots, but knows no level two spells.
* All magical weapons native to the plane have the property of returning if thrown, it's just a holdover baked into the process for making magic items that survived since fourth edi-I mean... the dawn war. On occasion this applies to other magical items, Frequently Tea Sets, A few local legal documents, and the odd sandal
* removing limbs, organs, or other body parts, or causing terminal failure of bodily function is henceforth considered damage.
* Sleeping in armor has no negative effects and is quite comfortable but the smell starts to stand out after a while
* Conjure woodland creatures and conjure animals now require the player to choose the animal. I don't need more work
* When a wild magic sorcerer casts a spell, they must roll a D4 and on a 1, a wild magic surge occurs
* The coefficient of friction on almost all force spells is negligible for almost all purposes, but if it comes up, say that it is variable but by default mimics glass. Allowing certain spells to be held and not, for example, for those same spells to achieve superluminal velocity
* The speed of light on this plane on average is actually significantly slower than it would be in a vacuum. 
* Antimagic field works by using up all of the magic in its area by Literally transforming it back into mana, with a little extra light an heat as inefficiency, as well as a very small but dense thaumatic field. Antimagic fields are fantastically stable but if they surround a volume too quickly, the trapped mana can result in wild magic surges.
* The First bullet of the shield master feat has been changed to "when you take the attack action, you may replace one of the attacks  with an attempt to try to shove a creature within 5 feet of you with your shield  and make another single melee attack as a bonus action, or you may take a  bonus action to try to shove a creature within 5 feet of you with your shield after taking the attack action on your turn. 
* Warlocks may now use intelligence as their casting stat
* Eldritch knights and Arcane Tricksters are not limited on their choice of schools of magic.
* All things that leave a corpse behind are assumed to have death saving throws. If it leaves a body, doubletap. This obviously does not apply to things that don't leave corpses, such as demons, Devils, angels, most fey, incorporeal undead, and most elementals.
* Plant growth only targets multicellular plants and only plants that are outside of a creature comparable to the spell's level.
