**Giants and Clicking and infrasound**
Giants in this world use click consonants in communication not unlike those found in many African languages, like !xhosa. This was originally just an aesthetic choice, I wanted the giants to be clearly mostly human but different from the average audience, and on top of that I wanted to empower whatever audience I was othering by making sure there was no real allegory tied to the cultures that used click consonants.  I wanted to include them somewhere. Combining these two ideas gave the giants, this intrinsically powerful race with its own unique cultures and attitudes, a different style of voice than just human 2, which in our context often just becomes a bland tweak of the western european narrative. Or at least it seems to. Including diverse elements might not promote accurate understanding of the cultures they came from but it at least tells someone that those elements are there and can be //understood. // As a result though, I also have to give giants a much better infrasound hearing range. Their mouths and throats are bigger, they're going to have deeper clicks and deeper voices. Incidentally, this means that their voices can travel farther and lends much more power to the narrative of the ordning. Low pitches have better times resisting attenuation than higher pitches, and in particular for the storm giants,  who spend much of their time underwater and far apart from eachother, this lends to their cultural narrative much much more than people expect. See, they're not really that spread out and distant from eachother in //their// eyes. They're at a respectable and reasonable range from which they can commnicate effectively if they need to while not being disruptive. They're probably not too different from humans proportionately on average. 

**Unicorns and Evil**
As axiomatically and artificially as centaurs being eaten by the sun, Unicorns in this world are (nearly) //always //evil. The logic (the highly disingenous logic) goes something like this. You have a creature that is capable of teleporting up to a mile and is usually the exceptional paragon of goodness and sparkles and other weird things. You have a plane which is host almost exclusively to creatures who got caught in failures of interplanar magic and the descendants thereof. How do those two combine? Anyone who is powerful enough to banish a unicorn and is good probably wouldn't want to. Anyone who is Powerful enough and is evil has less than no reason to, if they're evil, they'll just kill the unicorn and take its valuable alchemical parts, either for money or for their own uses. So who banishes unicorns and why? The answer is going to mostly be creatures who don't have the heart (or would be cursed by) the killing of  a unicorn. Good creatures. And the only unicorns they're going to ever want to just //banish?// Evil ones.  Selection processes like this are very important to Snarl and the prison planes setting, in particular because we're bards and everything must be finely crafted. That doesn't make it any less bullshit though. This is just a tongue-in-cheek way of stirring up the world so that it's not exactly what players expect. In my context, where people are used to worlds where their contexts are a bit more...whimsical... and less concerned with the broader effects of actions, this tends to come as a surprise, especially when there's a (what sounds like) valid reason for it.

**Steve**
Steve's the best guy and you lay the fuck off OK? Steve is a unicorn currently living in the realms of the trinity gulf, mostly just doing his own thing along with one other unicorn. Now. Importantly, when steve first came up, in was in a quest on Jianok Sio with the red mist pirate crew. They killed all the unicorns and captured four. One left with Usagi, the moon cleric, another left with Xundrin,  Two stayed with Tibeaux. One was evil and one was steve. We were playing on a battlemat at the time and I ran out of horse tokens and lego horses to represent the unicorns.... so I used the white bear lego piece we have. "It's a unicorn guys, shut up, his name is steve and he's the best". Well, Steve stuck around and got even better years later when I went looking for a picture of a unicorn bear and found Bjarndýrakóngur, A (purportedly) Icelandic Myth, sometimes calling this creature the king of the bears. A massive bear with, huh, a unicorn horn. One of the great lessons in worldbuilding is that syncretism and retrospect are tools that you can use to make people think you knew what you were doing the entire time. So now the king of the bears idles quietly in the far southern island of grand tortuga, lazily eating fish and generally just being the best.

**Halflings, Drow, Tieflings, and a new home**
In snarl, you'll find some peculiarities among the races. There are a heavy mix of old-hat tropes and strange new ideas in among cultures. The three most notable of these are the Halflings, the Drow, and the Tieflings. In general you can always tell who is native to snarl and who is not just by looking at them. The drow from other worlds are edgy, driven by lolth to do evil acts against their people, the culture held intact by one controlling narcissist of a god, who occasionally lets it fly apart. The Drow here are quiet, a bit spooky, and pretty independant but they're by no means evil. Very few of the drow seem to //care// anymore about other races, let alone their own. For their convenience many of them //do// live in cities, the major ones being Cermina and Skalmirthon, but many just live in isolated clusters in the underark. The halflings from other planes tend to be happy-go-lucky western european analogues with a love for food and mischief and somehow haven't had their community collapse under single power-hungry individuals. On Snarl, the halflings maintain their sense of community and their luck, but they are a much hardier and rough race, they are nomadic and far more willing to commit acts of violence, with a deeper respect for other people's property, if not their space. And Tieflings? Offworld tieflings are perpetually dour. Native tieflings all seem to have their own resting smile. While this facet isn't quite genetic, it //essentially //is hereditary. There are two reasons for all of these. In lore, the Drow are disconnected from lolth, she has only minor influence over them and has no desire to really partake in this world (though a player character, cleric of lolth might be the turning point). Yondalla, for the halflings offers her blessing of luck, but luck is stretched thin in this world, She is not as powerful as she wants to be for her people here. And the tieflings? It's a product of their infernal heritage, and a reference to the freedom that they experience on this plane, where the infernal entities are almost always just different types of prisoners including asmodeus humself. Out of lore, the drow culture is intrinsically matriarchical, and having the only matriarchy be //evil// doesn't have good echoes on it. It's not that it's not plausible, it's that by challenging it at all, it challenges people realize they wouldn't have questioned it otherwise. Whatever your answer, you at least have one now. This opened up the drow to the more distant theme that I use for elves on this plane. They're all effectively immortal and their grasp of consequence is hampered by their reincarnation, for once, perhaps to correlon's delight, the elves are all forced to be a bit different. In this case I used the drow to highlight how some cultures may have lasting elements from their original context, even when the greater context is removed. I did the opposite with the Halflings and let them keep their greater context, the favour of their god, but took away their culture and made them adapt. I left pebblerpony as the place where the new halflings usually end up going, a sort of shire analogue. As for tieflings, in the fourth edition character builder, from all of the tiefling art, there were four emotions: Dour, Angry, Impassive, and afraid. On occasion there was sadness. The tieflings were so ludicrously grim *except* for the last picture. Modai vell, apparently, had this big jolly smile on with this big glitter in his eye. That Image became Deloch welch, and the clothing was the reason for Manaharamu being placed in the desert. As the campaigns went on, with the exception of //one// person from the first three or so sessions, //every single tiefling was depicted smiling in their art. //**This was entirely by coincidence.** As mentioned before, retrospect and syncretism is no reason to not make it look like you knew what you were doing all along
