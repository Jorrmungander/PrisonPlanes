====== The Court of whispers ======
Created Saturday 15 August 2020

Tucked in the nightways and moonlit parts of the feywild, behind  Sprawling thin-branched trees is the realm of the court of whispers. The complexes that house the fey here are suited to their myriad plots and schemes and plans.

==== The Library of Lies ====
	The library of lies is a maze of woven Cypress trees and filled with tomes, scrolls, books, tablets, and other strange media for recording history. However, nothing in the library of lies is functionally true. It is a record **of** lies, told by either the fey or the people they manipulate. They keep extensive track and keep all of their stories documented so they can build up great catastrophes or spurts of growth as they choose. If you find a lie in this library, you are then certain that it is a lie that was told, these are annotated in the event that the lies are accidentally true.  The library lies within a stageroad, so there is always light by which to read. The Library is kept by The Horachibald
	
	**The Horachibald (ISTJ) **Court of Whispers, Archfey, (Fey sorcerer, whispers, 9)
		This mossy-backed warden does not appreciate undocumented lies in the library
			Height: 10'2
			Influence: 30 Deception (intelligence), A web of falsehoods that create no less that 12 paradoxes that seem to be solved within the falsehoods but aren't.
		A Triagular, deer-like cycloptic skull sports a single baleful lidless yellow eye upon its forehead. Upon this skull ther eis no skin, there are  no lips around the grinning,  toothy, mouth that sits tucked against the being's neck. Two long 8even-fingered (and a thumb) hands sit at the ends of very long forearms, clad in teal, clammy skin. The forearms attach to a slightly shorter length of upper arm which is anchored somewhere behind the thick mat of moss that constitutes the creature's body. The Horachibald carries a lantern on the end of a long scythe-like staff, with a gnarled but rather direct jut of wood where the blade would be. A small grinning pixie is chained to the staff and holds up the lantern in its hands. The Horachibald is the only entity in the library of lies that is not highlighted by the stageroad lights. If someone climbs to the top of the shelves and stacks of the library, one can usually spot the staff of the Horachibald as it wanders.
			

==== The Mistaken Well ====
	This pool of ink is filled with liquid illusion magic, the sort that jolts a mind. The fey use this to craft mistakes and flaws when they need to.  The thin, oily liquid tricks the senses, any sense, into being wrong. The power of the stuff is weak, but it does not need to be strong if it is well applied.
