====== The Court of Lore ======
Created Friday 14 August 2020


The court of lore is one of the strangest of the courts by nature of being the most familiar. The fey in this group are crafters of objects. Machines, shoes, carvings, dictionaries. Because of this peculiarity, they don't necessarily require favours, as their favours //are// material goods and exchanged services. It has been proposed more than once that all humanoid species and most creatures of the humanbonkers realm are fey of this type, but I am assured that this is not the case, though it does appear to be true for **gnomes. **By this nature, they are bound and bind with... well.. cages, chains, physical restraints. 


To a creature born into the Court of Lore, physical forces are what govern the rule of favour. The tightest curling of forces, the most abstract limits of their mathematics, the most distinguished curl of ink on a page, all stand to nourish them. A Lore Fey's craft is craft itself. Skill in the workfolkship of any object that lasts beyond their hands. They have the most solid works of any fey and care the least for promises

==== The Clockwork Castle And Tower of Lightning ====
	Built in a blasted plain on the stormy side of the morning, a Nacrous green castle with copper beams and trim stands watch around an impossibly tall standstone tower. The castle is filled with sounds of ticking and quiet but ponderous gears turning. The Clockwork castle houses seven vast machines, all warded and presided over by the **Lord of Wiles and Stone, The Gammunacteries Rayl. **The Rayl, the archfey of sequences, is the one who decides what crafts can be made real. They hold a very powerful place among the fey as a governing body used to deter certain horrors from emerging in the feywild. The Rayl is the only creature that can speak with **the Warden of Lightning, Archfey and ruler of the court of Lore. **The Warden of Lightning is an immensely powerful being that bestows raw inspiration unto the fey. They are the portal through which much of the magic of the feywild flows. They exist beyond the comprehension and power scales of most beings. In the eyes of the gods, the warden of lightning is as a sword, less powerful in a broad sense, but nearly indisputable in others. They sit within the tower of lightning, which acts as a gutter, allowing the magic that flows from them to enter the machinery of the clockwork castle, from which it disperses into the feywild.
	
	The Seven Machines housed in the clockwork tower each serve a different function, originally there were six until the potency of the vital pump was revealed to be useful to more mortal creatures
		* The wheel of the self-contained concept is a wide device of incredible efficiency that can make certain types of magic apply permanently to certain items. This is power beyond what can be found in the phb.
		* The Pendulum of duality has two functions. It can either invert the function of an item on a conceptual level or double its capacity, but can only do so once in each direction, and its effect depends on the direction the pendulum is currently swinging. If some aspect of the item is doubled, it becomes highly unstable, and has a 1 in 8000 chance of simply ceasing to exist at any moment (three critical failures in a row). The item cannot be boosted past a +5, nor can the pendulum boost the damage of a spell or an ability that a creature has. Inversion is best interpretted by the dungeon master with the advice that it is a conceptual inversion, it doesn't need to make perfect sense, but just enough. Sovreign glue can become either a terrifying explosive or just universal solvent.
		* The Vital Pump is a strange conversion device that originally wasn't one of the seven, as it is barely useful to the fey. The Device can double your remaining lifespan at the cost of half of your hit point maximum and vice versa.  The exchange is permanent and cannot be undone by anything other than the pump short of 10th level magic as you are //rewritten.//
