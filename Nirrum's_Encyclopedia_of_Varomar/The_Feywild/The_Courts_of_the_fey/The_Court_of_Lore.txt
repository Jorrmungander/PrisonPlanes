====== The Court of Lore ======
Created Friday 14 August 2020


The court of lore is one of the strangest of the courts by nature of being the most familiar. The fey in this group are crafters of objects. Machines, shoes, carvings, dictionaries. Because of this peculiarity, they don't necessarily require favours, as their favours //are// material goods and exchanged services. It has been proposed more than once that all humanoid species and most creatures of the humanbonkers realm are fey of this type, but I am assured that this is not the case, though it does appear to be true for **gnomes. **By this nature, they are bound and bind with... well.. cages, chains, physical restraints. 


To a creature born into the Court of Lore, physical forces are what govern the rule of favour. The tightest curling of forces, the most abstract limits of their mathematics, the most distinguished curl of ink on a page, all stand to nourish them. A Lore Fey's craft is craft itself. Skill in the workfolkship of any object that lasts beyond their hands. They have the most solid works of any fey and care the least for promises
